/**
 * Nightly reconciliation.
 *
 * Re-pulls a trailing window and upserts, which is what keeps the dashboard in
 * agreement with Ads Manager as Meta restates spend and conversions over the
 * following weeks.
 *
 * Safe to call at ANY cadence. Each client is picked up only once its local
 * reconcile hour has passed without a reconcile since (see `@/lib/reconcile`),
 * so this is idempotent and several triggers can coexist: a frequent external
 * schedule for timeliness, plus Vercel's once-daily cron as a backstop. Whichever
 * fires first does the work; the other finds nothing to do.
 *
 * Query params:
 *   ?force=1  — ignore the overdue gate and reconcile every active client.
 *   ?hour=N   — override the local reconcile hour (default 3).
