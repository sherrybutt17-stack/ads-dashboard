/*
 * 🔴 An OAuth callback must hand off to somewhere that can actually finish the job.
 *
 * The Google flow was dead for exactly this reason and nothing caught it. The
 * callback exchanged the code, stashed the refresh token, wrote its audit row —
 * and then redirected to `/oauth/result?status=ok`, while that page reads
 * `status === "success"`. So a successful sign-in rendered the failure screen.
 * Even had the strings matched, the page does nothing with the stash, so the
 * flow ended one step before an account could be attached. The route was
 * documented in its own source as "the self-serve front door" and was
 * unreachable in practice.
 *
 * Two invariants, both silent when broken:
 *   1. A successful connect lands on the setup page, not on the result page.
 *   2. The query parameter the callback writes is the one the page reads.
