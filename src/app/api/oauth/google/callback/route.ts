 * Unlike the GHL callback — which must stay open, because a marketplace install
 * can be initiated from GHL's side with no session cookie — this one is
 * **staff-guarded**. There is no path to it that does not begin at our own
 * authorize route, which is itself staff-only, so leaving it open would widen
 * the surface for nothing.
 *
 * The signed `state` is still verified in full: it binds the tokens to the
 * client id the flow started with, and the cookie comparison is the CSRF check.
 * Neither is redundant. The signature stops a tampered client id; the cookie
 * stops someone else's completed consent being replayed into this browser.
